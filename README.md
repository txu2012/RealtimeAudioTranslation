# RealtimeAudioTranslation
 
Uses PyAudio, Google Translate, and OpenAi Whisper to capture computer audio and translate in real time.

To capture computer audio, a loopback system is needed to feed audio into an input for pyaudio to record. A virtual audio cable (eg. VB Audio) can be used to create a loopback to capture from.

**Note: Google translate does not translate 100% accurately, but translator can be swapped in the future.

To Use:
----
Select the loopback device that can be captured from and press start.
